Hello there, reader. We're proud to present- the About page. Although, there's a catch- this page doesn't only house information about us and our team, there's a brand-new About You section as well. Read along, you must.

##About Us

"coDesign" is a curation network that houses some of the best articles from all across the blogosphere (the virtual universe consisting of numerous blogs) related to code and design.

Don't worry, reader- we have an extensive "Editorial Guidelines" document housed just for you, so that you can be assured of the fact that at "coDesign," we hold quality in a higher regard than quantity.

Now, one might ask- "What type of content will I expect once I land on the homepage of your blog?"

Our aptly named publication houses aggregated (and curated) links for (a)the latest code+design news and (b)the best of the code+design stories / podcasts / videos / tutorials. 


##Our Team

We're a set of passionate tech-enthusiasts that love code, design, rubber ducks and coffee. Although this section is labelled "Our Team," we're really "Your Team," working to keep you as updated as we can! Why?- It makes us happy and gives us an excuse to keep that coffee coming.

##About You

You- the readers, the community. You are the reason this blog exists, you're the reason we work as hard as we can to keep the lights on and club quality content into a centralize, unified interface (coDesign).

We've made a [Telegram Group](https://t.me/coDesign) and [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/codedesign_io) just for you! In addition, we created a [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/codedesign_io), an [Instagram account](https://instagram.com/codedesign_io), and a [Pinterest Board](https://pinterest.com/codedesign_io) as well- in order to keep you as updated as wel possibly can.

The best aspect of our process of writing is that every single story is opened to the community via [a repository hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/coDesign/content).

Although not a lot of errors slip through our editorial process, we're all humans. You can easily submit a Pull Request at the repository to (a)point out (factual / grammatical / human) errors, (b)add content to the summarized entities, (c)propose new features and (d)apply for a role yourself.
